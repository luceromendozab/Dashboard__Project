## Introduction  

[My Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lucero.mendoza8271/viz/salaries_16756398287530/DashboardWORLD?publish=yes) was created with the purpose of providing detailed information about the average salaries of data scientists in different countries and regions of the world. 

The dashboard consists of several pages that offer different visualizations and statistics on the average salaries of data scientists in different countries. Users can select different countries  to view average salaries and compare them to other places. They can also explore different factors, such as work experience, emplyment type,   which can affect salaries.

## Metodology 

- csv from Kaggle 
- clean :here 

## Results Analysis
Our analysis of the data showed that average salaries for data scientists vary significantly by country and region. The highest salaries are found in the United States and some countries in Western Europe, while the lowest salaries are found in some countries in Latin America and Asia.

Spain? 

We also found that factors such as work experience have a significant impact on the  salaries. Professionals with more experience and education tend to earn more, regardless of the country or region they work in.

## Tools

- [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/es-es): is a data visualization software that allows users to connect, visualize, and share data in interactive and engaging ways
- Python: is a versatile and powerful language that is widely used and respected by developers and organizations around the world.
- Pandas: is a popular open-source Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. 
- Country_converter: is a Python library that provides a convenient way to convert country names, ISO codes, and other country-related information. It is particularly useful in data analysis and research where data from multiple sources may use different country names or codes.

## Next Steps
This analysis and dashboard have several limitations especially in countries where salary data is not publicly available. 

In the future, it is crucial to incorporate more data and variables into our analysis to create more detailed visualizations. We would also like to integrate predictive models and machine learning into our dashboard to provide projections of future salaries.

## Requirements and Dependencies

To run this dashboard, it is necessary to have a compatible web browser installed and have access to the downloaded files in the repository. No other dependencies or libraries are required.
