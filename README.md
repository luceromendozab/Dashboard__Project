## Introduction  
Have you ever wondered how much data analysts earn in other countries? How does the data analyst salary in your country compare to other places in the world?  I'm sure you're interested in learning more about salaries in the industry! 

That's why I decided to create this dashboard, to help students get a better understanding of industry salaries.

[My Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lucero.mendoza8271/viz/salaries_16756398287530/DashboardWORLD?publish=yes) consists of several pages that offer different visualizations and statistics on the average salaries of data scientists in different countries. First users can select different countries to view them and compare them to other places, exploring different factors, such as work experience, employment type and the company size. Finally  considering my own location and the average salaries in different countries , I decided to compare salaries between Spain and USA because I was interested in how the supply and demand of data professionals impacted compensation in these two countries.Spain and the USA have different economic contexts, which I thought could lead to interesting comparisons in terms of salaries and job opportunities.

## Data Sources

The data for this dashboard comes from the following sources:

- [Kaggle Data Science Job Salaries ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries)

## Results Analysis
Our analysis of the data showed that average salaries for data scientists vary significantly by country and region. The highest salaries are found in the United States and some countries in Western Europe, while the lowest salaries are found in some countries in Latin America and Asia.

Regarding the analysis of differences between Spain and the United States we also can see that there is a positive correlation between years of experience and salary for both . However, the salaries in the USA are generally higher than in Spain for each level.

It should be noted that while in Spain remote work prevails with 85.71%, and  partiallly-remote work with 14.29% , in  USA on-site work can still be observed with 20%. This may be caused by cultural differences: in Spain, there may be more emphasis on work-life balance, and remote work may be seen as a way to achieve this balance. By contrast, the US may have a more traditional office culture where face-to-face interaction is valued.

And as a curious fact, in Spain a small company pays better on average than a large one, this may be cause because smaller companies may have less bureaucracy and be more flexible in terms of compensation. Spain may need more demand for talent and need skilled workers compared to larger countries such as the USA, which means that small companies may need to pay higher salaries to attract and retain the best employees.

On the other hand, larger companies in the USA may be able to pay more due to their greater financial resources, economy, and the ability to attract a larger pool of highly skilled workers. Larger companies may also have more established career paths and training programs, which can lead to higher salaries and greater opportunities for advancement.

## Tools

- [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/es-es): is a data visualization software that allows users to connect, visualize, and share data in interactive and engaging ways
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): is a powerful programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) : is a popular open-source Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. 
- [Country_converter](https://pypi.org/project/country-converter/): is a Python library that provides a convenient way to convert country names, ISO codes, and other country-related information. It is particularly useful in data analysis and research where data from multiple sources may use different country names or codes.

## Next Steps
This analysis and dashboard have several limitations especially in countries where salary data is not publicly available. 

In the future, it is crucial to incorporate more data and variables into our analysis to create more detailed visualizations. We would also like to integrate predictive models and machine learning into our dashboard to provide projections of future salaries.

## Requirements and Dependencies

To run this dashboard, it is necessary to have a compatible web browser installed and have access to the downloaded files in the repository. No other dependencies or libraries are required.
